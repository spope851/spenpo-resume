## v1.0.0 - 2024-11-21
### Added
* seed.sql script that creates the resume tables and is executed against the database as an initialization hook by executeScript function
* shortcode that creates and renders a DOMDocument with the resume content. styled via style.css
* api endpoint that returns resume content as json for consumers
* teardown script for dropping tables when uninstalling the plugin
* admin dashboard with auth switch for REST API endpoint
* generated documentation readme and error handling
* unit test suite in /tests
* setup composer and phpunit
* base integration test
### Changed
* added $type param to executeScript function to choose between dbDelta() and $wpdb->query()
* refactored repository pattern to abstract specific code into classes
* refactored the api to use the singleton pattern and serve the json and the REST route separately. now all consumers including the plugin shortcode are serviced by the same function fetchResume.
* implemented reusable createElement function for DOM manipulation across the resume shortcode
* Added mandatory and optional display order fields to all tables
* Madd all class names generic and appended unique identifiers to class names in id attribute
* moved teardown function to uninstall hook
* slight changes to some classes for testability. added namespaces to all classes
### Fixed
* logical bug with $type param in executeScript funtion
